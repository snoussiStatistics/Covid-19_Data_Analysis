# Covid-19_Data_Analysis

This repository will contain Covid_19 Analysis conducted by me using R programming.

the data was downloaded from this site https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data


## First task 

My first task will be to create functions easy to use in order to avoid repetetion of the ggplot routine, 
for visualizing data change over time for a given variable and a given country (or countries).

- MakePlot(country,variable)
- distinguishFrom(country , continent , variable)
- comparePlots(countries , variable ) 

you will find a file named functions.r in this repo which contain the code for these 3 function and a furthermore explanation of the usage of the functions.
